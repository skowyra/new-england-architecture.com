    # The SDC doesn't know what context it's being placed, so we allow sizes to
    # be modified, e.g. if it's being used in a row of 4 as opposed to full width.
    # In reality sizes would likely be hidden from content authors as it requires
    # some HTML knowledge to use correctly, but shown here for testing purposes.
